## Linked-list
- [ ] add user example

## Red-black tree

- [ ] add difference and intersection tests
- [x] add import / export / copy test
- [ ] implement build from unsorted array (import)
- [x] implement filter operation
- [x] implement update node operation

- [ ] tide-up function names, keep consistency with list names
- [ ] add a simple example of using the library
- [ ] example of destructive / nondestructive operations

##### Set operations

- [ ] storing black height at nodes (efficiency of set-ops)
- [ ] maybe overload operators + * - for union, intersection and differenve
- [ ] encapsulation as tree/tree operations?
- [ ] join-based insert / delete (just for fun)
- [ ] import/export to file (directly or implement save/load of arrays in common_mod)

#### A tree module with a linear allocator
- [ ] test the concept
- [ ] basic implementation and speed comparisons

## Other notes

#### Naming methods suggestions

- insert(value)
- erase(value)
- erase(iterator)
- find(value)
- begin() / end() --> iterators get_leftmost
- size(), empty()
- lower_bound(value) --> first element not less than value
- upper_bound(value)
- clear() -> remove all elements from the set
- copy_tree, free_tree
- isvalid()
- read() / update() /
