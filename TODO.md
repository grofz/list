### Red-black tree

- [x] join and split
- [x] optimize join+split process (no reallocations)
- [x] black height
- [x] allow that root is red
- [x] union  (with test)
- [ ] insert and delete tests

- [ ] tide-up function names, consistent with list names
- [ ] example of simple tree usage

#####Set operations

- [ ] test intersection/difference
- [ ] operations are destructive, implement read-only variants?
- [ ] build from array (or sorted array)
- [ ] filter
- [ ] duplicate
- [ ] tidy-up code
- [ ] encapsulation as tree/tree operations?
- [ ] join-based insert / delete ??
- [ ] import/export of data to an array

A tree module with a linear allocator
- [ ] basic implementation and speed comparisons
